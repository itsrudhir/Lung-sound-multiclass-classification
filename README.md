# Lung-sound-multiclass-classification
A multiclass classification using Computer Vision concepts implemented on OpenCV to classify things on basis of lung sounds.


This project uses machine learning library Opencv and is a implementation of Computer Vision concepts to classify the diseasesd and normal persons in the terms of presence of pulmonary diseases. The model takes the lung sound of the patients as input recorded, and uses extracted spectrogram to extract feature vectors using feature-label paradigm.
